# operating-system-cpu-schedule
In our operating system project, we explore multilevel queue scheduling with a fixed  preemptive approach, distinguished by two priority queues: q1 and q2. With q1 holding higher  priority, we've implemented a round-robin scheduling algorithm, while q2 operates under the  non-preemptive shortest job first principle.
